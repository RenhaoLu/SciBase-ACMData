Recent advent of manycore system increases needs for larger but faster memory hierarchy. Emerging next generation memories such as on-chip DRAM and nonvolatile memory (NVRAM) are promising candidates for replacement of DRAM-only main memory. Combined with the manycore trends, it gives an opportunity to rethink conventional resource management system with a memory hierarchy for a single cloud node. In an attempt to mitigate the energy and memory problems, we propose MN-MATE, an elastic resource management architecture for a single cloud node with manycores, on-chip DRAM, and large size of off-chip DRAM and NVRAM. In MN-MATE, the hypervisor places consolidated VMs and balances memory among them. Based on the monitored information about the allocated memory, a guest OS co-schedules tasks accessing different types of memory with complementary access intensity. Polymorphic management of DRAM hierarchy accelerates average memory access speed inside each guest OS. A guest OS reduces energy consumption with small performance loss based on the NVRAM-aware data placement policy and the hybrid page cache. A new lightweight kernel is developed to reduce the overhead from the guest OS for scientific applications. Experiment results show that our techniques in MN-MATE platform improve system performance and reduce energy consumption.
