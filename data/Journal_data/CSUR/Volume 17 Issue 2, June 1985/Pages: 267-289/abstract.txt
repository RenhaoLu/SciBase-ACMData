This paper is a study of the unique problems posed by the use of computers by composers and performers of music. The paper begins with a presentation of the basic concepts involved in the musical interaction with computer devices, followed by a detailed discussion of three musical tasks: music manuscript preparation, music language interfaces for composition, and real-time performance interaction. Fundamental design principles are exposed through an examination of several early computer music systems, especially the Structured Sound Synthesis Project. A survey of numerous systems, based on the following categories, is presented: compositions and synthesis languages, graphics score editing, performance instruments, digital audio processing tools, and computer-aided instruction in music systems. An extensive reference list is provided for further study in the field.
