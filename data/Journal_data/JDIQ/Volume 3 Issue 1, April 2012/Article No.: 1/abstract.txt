Different clinics and hospitals have their own information systems to maintain patient data. This hinders the exchange of data among systems (and organizations). Hence there is a need to provide standards for data exchange. In digitized form, the individual patient's medical record can be stored, retrieved, and shared over a network through enhancement in information technology. Thus, electronic health records (EHRs) should be standardized, incorporating semantic interoperability. A subsequent step requires that healthcare professionals and patients get involved in using the EHRs, with the help of technological developments. This study aims to provide different approaches in understanding some current and challenging concepts in health informatics. Successful handling of these challenges will lead to improved quality in healthcare by reducing medical errors, decreasing costs, and enhancing patient care. The study is focused on the following goals: (1) understanding the role of EHRs; (2) understanding the need for standardization to improve quality; (3) establishing interoperability in maintaining EHRs; (4) examining a framework for standardization and interoperability (the openEHR architecture; (5) identifying the role of archetypes for knowledge-based systems; and (6) understanding the difficulties in querying HER data.
