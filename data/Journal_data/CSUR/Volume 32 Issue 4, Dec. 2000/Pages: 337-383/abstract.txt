Logical models of arguement formalize commonsense reasoning while taking process and computation seriously. This survey discusses the main ideas that characterize different logical models of argument. It presents the formal features of a few features of a few main approaches to the modeling of argumentation. We trace the evolution of argumentation from the mid-1980s, when argument systems emerged as an alternative to nonmonotonic formalisms based on classical logic, to the present, as argument in embedded in different complex systems for real-world applications, and allow more formal work to be done in different areas, such as AI and Law, case-based reasoning and negotiation among intelligent agents.
