As users entrust more and more of their applications to computer
systems, the need for systems that are continuously operational (24
hours per day) has become even greater. This paper presents a
survey and analysis of representative architectures and techniques
that have been developed for constructing highly available systems
for database applications. It then proposes a design of a
distributed software subsystem that can serve as a unified
framework for constructing database application systems that meet
various requirements for high availability.
