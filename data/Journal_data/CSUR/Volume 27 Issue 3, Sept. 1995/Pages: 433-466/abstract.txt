Two-dimensional image motion is the projection of the three-dimensional motion of objects, relative to a visual sensor, onto its image plane. Sequences of time-orderedimages allow the estimation of projected two-dimensional image motion as either instantaneous image velocities or discrete image displacements. These are usually called theoptical flow fieldor theimage velocity field. Provided that optical flow is a reliable approximation to two-dimensional image motion, it may then be used to recover the three-dimensional motion of the visual sensor (to within a scale factor) and the three-dimensional surface structure (shape or relative depth) through assumptions concerning the structure of the optical flow field, the three-dimensional environment, and the motion of the sensor. Optical flow may also be used to perform motion detection, object segmentation, time-to-collision and focus of expansion calculations, motion compensated encoding, and stereo disparity measurement. We investigate the computation of optical flow in this survey: widely known methods for estimating optical flow are classified and examined by scrutinizing the hypothesis and assumptions they use. The survey concludes with a discussion of current research issues.
