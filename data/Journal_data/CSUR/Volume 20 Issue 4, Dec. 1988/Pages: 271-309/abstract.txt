A tutorial survey is presented of hierarchical data structures for representing collections of small rectangles. Rectangles are often used as an approximation of shapes for which they serve as the minimum rectilinear enclosing object. They arise in applications in cartography as well as very large-scale integration (VLSI) design rule checking. The different data structures are discussed in terms of how they support the execution of queries involving proximity relations. The focus is on intersection and subset queries. Several types of representations are described. Some are designed for use with the plane-sweep paradigm, which works well for static collections of rectangles. Others are oriented toward dynamic collections. In this case, one representation reduces each rectangle to a point in a higher multidimensional space and treats the problem as one involving point data. The other representation is area basedâ€”that is, it depends on the physical extent of each rectangle.
