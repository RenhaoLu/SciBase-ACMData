A new type of dynamic file access calleddynamic hashinghas recently emerged. It promises the flexibility of handling dynamic files while preserving the fast access times expected from hashing. Such a fast, dynamic file access scheme is needed to support modern database systems. This paper surveys dynamic file access scheme is needed to support modern database systems. This paper surveys dynamic hashing schemes and examines their critical design issues.
