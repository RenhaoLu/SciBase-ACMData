Awareness of data and information quality issues has grown rapidly in light of the critical role played by the quality of information in our data-intensive, knowledge-based economy. Research in the past two decades has produced a large body of data quality knowledge and has expanded our ability to solve many data and information quality problems. In this article, we present an overview of the evolution and current landscape of data and information quality research. We introduce a framework to characterize the research along two dimensions:topicsandmethods. Representative papers are cited for purposes of illustrating the issues addressed and the methods used. We also identify and discuss challenges to be addressed in future research.
