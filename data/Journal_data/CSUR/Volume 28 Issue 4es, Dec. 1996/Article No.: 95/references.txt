In Value Migration (Harvard Business School Press 1995) Adrian Slywotzky discusses at great length the concept of business design and gives many examples of customers migrating to new business designs that offer them greater value.
In School's Out (Avon Books 1992), Lewis Perelman discusses in great detail his vision of the future of education, a paradigm he calls hyperlearning. Definitely read this. You are likely to find this book deeply disturbing. You can find out more about Perelman's thinking from his interview with the Journal of Bionomics (September 1996 at http://www.bionomics.org) and from his own web site (http://www.cris.com/~Kanbrain).
In Post Capitalist Society (Harper Business 1993), Peter Drucker lays out a vision of what teaching and learning for the knowledge worker will entail. This expands on an earlier version of his vision in The New Realities (Harper & Row 1989).
Beginning with Charles Sykes's ProfScam (St Martin's Press 1988), various authors have written best-selling, iconoclastic books about disease and corruption in the academy. Even if you don't accept the premises of these books, they were best sellers and hundreds of thousands of people paid $24.95 to own one or more of them. If nothing else, they give good insight into what ails the current business design of universities.
Eli Noam was interviewed in Educom Review, May/June 1996. He spoke specifically about the way information technology is undermining the traditional assumptions of the university.

The Economist (24th August 1996, page 14) ran an editorial entitled ``Teaching Spires'', questioning whether the publish-or-perish syndrome is actually serving the original purposes of Humboldt's research university.
Last (and least) I have written several articles containing some of these themes. You can find them in the Communications of ACM, December 1992, July 1993, and May 1996.
