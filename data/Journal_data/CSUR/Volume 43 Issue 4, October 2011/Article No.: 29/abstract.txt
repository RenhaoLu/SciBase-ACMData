Geometric distortion measurement and the associated metrics involved are integral to the Rate Distortion (RD) shape coding framework, with importantly the efficacy of the metrics being strongly influenced by the underlying measurement strategy. This has been the catalyst for many different techniques with this article presenting a comprehensive review of geometric distortion measurement, the diverse metrics applied, and their impact on shape coding. The respective performance of these measuring strategies is analyzed from both a RD and complexity perspective, with a recent distortion measurement technique based on arc-length-parameterization being comparatively evaluated. Some contemporary research challenges are also investigated, including schemes to effectively quantify shape deformation.
