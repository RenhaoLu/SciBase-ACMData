This article surveys the definition and application of an enhancement of structural operational semantics in the field of concurrent systems, and also addresses issues of distribution and mobility of code. The focus is on how enriching the labels of transitions with encodings of their deduction trees is sufficient to derive qualitative and quantitative information on the systems in hand simply by relabeling the transitions of a unique concrete model.
