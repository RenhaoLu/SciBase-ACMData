The bibliography appearing at the end of this article lists 37 sorting algorithms and 100 books and papers on sorting published in the last 20 years. The basic ideas presented here have been abstracted from this body of work, and the best algorithms known are given as examples. As the algorithms are explained, references to related algorithms and mathematical or experimental analyses are given. Suggestions are then made for choosing the algorithm best suited to a given situation.
