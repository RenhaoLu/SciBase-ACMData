Managing Service Level Agreement (SLA) within a cloud-based system is important to maintain service continuity and improve trust due to cloud flexibility and scalability. We conduct a general review on cloud-based systems to understand how service continuity and trust are addressed in cloud SLA management. The review shows that SLA renegotiation is necessary to improve trust and maintain service continuity; however, research on SLA renegotiation is limited. Of the two key approaches in renegotiation, namely bargaining-based negotiation and offer generation--based negotiation, the latter approach is the most promising due to its ability to generate optimized multiple-offer SLA parameters within one round during renegotiation.
