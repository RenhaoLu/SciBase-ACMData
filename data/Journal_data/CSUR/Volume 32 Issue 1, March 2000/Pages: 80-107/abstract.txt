Cellular automata are simple models of computation which exhibit 
fascinatingly complex behavior. They have captured the attention of several generations of researchers, leading to an extensive body of work. Here we trace a history of cellular automata from their beginnings with von Neumann to the present day. The emphasis is mainly on topics closer to computer science and mathematics rather than physics, biology or other applications. The work should be of interest to both new entrants into the field as well as researchers working on particular aspects of cellular automata.
