The article “Temporal Logics for Real-Time System Specification” surveys some of the relevant literature dealing with the use of temporal logics for the specification of real-time systems. Unfortunately, it introduces some imprecisions that might create some confusion in the reader. While a certain degree of informality is certainly useful when addressing a broad audience, imprecisions can negatively impact the legibility of the exposition. We clarify some of its remarks on a few topics, in an effort to contribute to the usefulness of the survey for the reader.
