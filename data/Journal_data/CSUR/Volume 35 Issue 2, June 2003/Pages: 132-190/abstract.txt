Requirements interaction management (RIM) is the set of activities directed toward the discovery, management, and disposition of critical relationships among sets of requirements, which has become a critical area of requirements engineering. This survey looks at the evolution of supporting concepts and their related literature, presents an issues-based framework for reviewing processes and products, and applies the framework in a review of RIM state-of-the-art. Finally, it presents seven research projects that exemplify this emerging discipline.
