Craniofacial superimposition is a forensic process in which a photograph of a missing person is compared with a skull found to determine its identity. After one century of development, craniofacial superimposition has become an interdisciplinary research field where computer sciences have acquired a key role as a complement of forensic sciences. Moreover, the availability of new digital equipment (such as computers and 3D scanners) has resulted in a significant advance in the applicability of this forensic identification technique. The purpose of this contribution is twofold. On the one hand, we aim to clearly define the different stages involved in the computer-aided craniofacial superimposition process. Besides, we aim to clarify the role played by computers in the methods considered.In order to accomplish these objectives, an up-to-date review of the recent works is presented along with a discussion of advantages and drawbacks of the existing approaches, with an emphasis on the automatic ones. Future case studies will be easily categorized by identifying which stage is tackled and which kind of computer-aided approach is chosen to face the identification problem. Remaining challenges are indicated and some directions for future research are given.
