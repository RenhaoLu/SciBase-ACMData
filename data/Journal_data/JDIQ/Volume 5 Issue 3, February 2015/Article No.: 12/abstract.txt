In this article, we present a model for quality assessment over linked data. This model has been designed to align with emerging standards for provenance on the Web to enable agents to reason about data provenance when performing quality assessment. The model also enables quality assessment provenance to be represented, thus allowing agents to make decisions about reuse of existing assessments. We also discuss the development of an OWL ontology as part of a software framework to support reasoning about data quality and assessment reuse. Finally, we evaluate this framework using two real-world case studies derived from transport and invasive-species monitoring applications.
