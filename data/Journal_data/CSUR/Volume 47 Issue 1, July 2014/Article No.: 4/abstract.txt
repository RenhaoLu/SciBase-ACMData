Languages that combine aspects of probabilistic representations with aspects of first-order logic are referred to as first-order probabilistic languages (FOPLs). FOPLs can be divided into three categories: rule-based, procedural-based and entity-relation--based languages. This article presents a survey of directed entity-relation--based FOPLs and their associated model construction and inference algorithms.
