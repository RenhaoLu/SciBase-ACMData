We present a survey of research into automated and semiautomated computer systems for expressive performance of music. We will examine the motivation for such systems and then examine the majority of the systems developed over the last 25 years. To highlight some of the possible future directions for new research, the review uses primary terms of reference based on four elements: testing status, expressive representation, polyphonic ability, and performance creativity.
