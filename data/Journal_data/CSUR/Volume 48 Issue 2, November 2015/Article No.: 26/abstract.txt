Physically unclonable functions(PUFs) exploit the unavoidable manufacturing variations of an Integrated Circuit (IC). Their input-output behavior serves as a unique IC “fingerprint.” Therefore, they have been envisioned as an IC authentication mechanism, in particular the subclass of so-called strong PUFs. The protocol proposals are typically accompanied with two PUF promises: lightweight and an increased resistance against physical attacks. In this work, we review 19 proposals in chronological order: from the original strong PUF proposal (2001) to the more complicated noise bifurcation and system of PUF proposals (2014). The assessment is aided by a unified notation and a transparent framework of PUF protocol requirements.
