Vessel segmentation algorithms are the critical components of circulatory blood vessel analysis systems. We present a survey of vessel extraction techniques and algorithms. We put the various vessel extraction approaches and techniques in perspective by means of a classification of the existing research. While we have mainly targeted the extraction of blood vessels, neurosvascular structure in particular, we have also reviewed some of the segmentation methods for the tubular objects that show similar characteristics to vessels. We have divided vessel segmentation algorithms and techniques into six main categories: (1) pattern recognition techniques, (2) model-based approaches, (3) tracking-based approaches, (4) artificial intelligence-based approaches, (5) neural network-based approaches, and (6) tube-like object detection approaches. Some of these categories are further divided into subcategories. We have also created tables to compare the papers in each category against such criteria as dimensionality, input type, preprocessing, user interaction, and result type.
