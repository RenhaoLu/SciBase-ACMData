LEHMER, D. H Private communication, Feb. 12, 1976. Prof. Lehmer also showed analytically that the maximum distance one has been from the starting point is, for a congruential generator, independent of the number of steps, but increases monotone with period, and that for a Brownian motion the distance increases monotone with number of steps. He suggested that, m practice, such testmg should examine a small part of the path of a sequence of long period. We hope that he will be able to perform experiments of this type using a polyprocessor machine having the enormous power that will be required for practical results
