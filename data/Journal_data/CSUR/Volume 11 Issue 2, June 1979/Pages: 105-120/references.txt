The authors show how pricing can serve as a more effective means of allocating computer resources and transmitting demand information to the user.

Controls promoting congruency include "hard" and "soft" money; user budgets for EDP costs; and prices for EDP use. Through proper application of these controls, the author shows that the firm can maximize tts use of resources.
