Fault tolerance in distributed computing is a wide area with a significant body of literature that is vastly diverse in methodology and terminology. This paper aims at structuring the area and thus guiding readers into this interesting field. We use a formal approach to define important terms likefault, fault tolerance, andredundancy. This leads to four distinct forms of fault tolerance and to two main phases in achieving them:detectionandcorrection. We show that this can help to reveal inherently fundamental structures that contribute to understanding and unifying methods and terminology. By doing this, we survey many existing methodologies and discuss their relations. The underlying system model is the   close-to-reality asynchronous message-passing model of distributed computing.
