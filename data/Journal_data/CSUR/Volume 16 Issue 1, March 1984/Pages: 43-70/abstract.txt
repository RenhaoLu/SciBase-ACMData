During the past ten years, the field of multiple-access
communication has developed into a major area of both practical and
theoretical interest within the field of computer communications.
The multiple-access problem arises from the necessity of sharing a
single communication channel among a community of distributed
users. The distributed algorithm used by the stations to share the
channel is known as the multiple-access protocol. In this paper we
examine the multiple-access problem and various approaches to its
resolution.In this survey we first define the multiple-access problem and
then present the underlying issues and difficulties in achieving
multiple-access communication. A taxonomy for multiple-access
protocols is then developed in order to characterize common
approaches and to provide a framework within which these protocols
can be compared and contrasted. Different proposed protocols are
then described and discussed, and aspects of their performance are
examined. The use of multiple-access protocols for "real- time" or
"time-constrained" communication applications, such as voice
transmission, is examined next. Issues in time-constrained
communication are identified, and recent work in the design of
time-constrained multiple-access protocols is surveyed.
