This paper presents a framework for sharing JavaBeans applications in real-time synchronous collaboration. A generic collaboration bus provides a plug-and-play environment that enables collaboration with applications that may or may not be collaboration aware. Research on knowledge-based quality-of-service management and multimodel human/machine interface is described.
