A statistical profile summarizes the instances of a database. It describes aspects such as the number of tuples, the number of values, the distribution of values, the correlation between value sets, and the distribution of tuples among secondary storage units. Estimation of database profiles is critical in the problems of query optimization, physical database design, and database performance prediction. This paper describes a model of a database of profile, relates this model to estimating the cost of database operations, and surveys methods of estimating profiles. The operators and objects in the model include build profile, estimate profile, and update profile. The estimate operator is classified by the relational algebra operator (select, project, join), the property to be estimated (cardinality, distribution of values, and other parameters), and the underlying method (parametric, nonparametric, and ad-hoc). The accuracy, overhead, and assumptions of methods are discussed in detail. Relevant research in both the database and the statistics disciplines is incorporated in the detailed discussion.
