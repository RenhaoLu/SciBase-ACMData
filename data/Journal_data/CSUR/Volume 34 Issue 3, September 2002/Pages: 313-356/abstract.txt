Graph layout problems are a particular class of combinatorial optimization problems whose goal is to find a linear layout of an input graph in such way that a certain objective cost is optimized. This survey considers their motivation, complexity, approximation properties, upper and lower bounds, heuristics and probabilistic analysis on random graphs. The result is a complete view of the current state of the art with respect to layout problems from an algorithmic point of view.
