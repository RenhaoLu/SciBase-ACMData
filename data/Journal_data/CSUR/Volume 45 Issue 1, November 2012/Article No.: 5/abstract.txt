Since 1977, when Lempel and Ziv described a kind of string factorization useful for text compression, there has been a succession of algorithms proposed for computing “LZ factorization”. In particular, there have been several recent algorithms proposed that extend the usefulness of LZ factorization, for example, to the calculation of maximal repetitions. In this article, we provide an overview of these new algorithms and compare their efficiency in terms of their usage of time and space.
