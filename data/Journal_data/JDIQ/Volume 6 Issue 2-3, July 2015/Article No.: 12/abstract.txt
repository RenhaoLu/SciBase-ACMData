Information is a strategic company resource, but there is no consensus in the literature regarding the set of dimensions to be considered when measuring the quality of the information. Most measures of information quality depend on user perception. Using multiple correlation analysis, we obtain a model that allows us to explain how information quality dimensions influence information consumersâ€™ overall feeling of being well informed. A set of dimensions that any measure of information quality should at least include is proposed. This exploratory study reports the results of a research survey among managers of companies committed to quality management within the framework of a Total Quality Management (TQM) model, which is an information-intensive management model.
