In geometric range searching, algorithmic problems of the following type are considered. Given ann-point set P in the plane, build a data structure so that, given a query triangle R, the number of points of P lying in R can be determined quickly. Similar questions can be asked for point sets in higher dimensions, with triangles replaced by simplices or by more complicated shapes. Algorithms of this type are of crucial importance in computational geometry, as they can be used as subroutines in solutions to many seemingly unrelated problems, which are often motivated by practical applications, for instance in computer graphics (ray tracing, hidden-surface removal etc.). We present a survey of theoretical results and the main techniques in geometric range  searching.
