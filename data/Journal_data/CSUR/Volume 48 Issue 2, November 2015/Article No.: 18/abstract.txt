The term “System of Systems” (SoS) has been used since the 1950s to describe systems that are composed of independent constituent systems, which act jointly towards a common goal through the synergism between them. Examples of SoS arise in areas such as power grid technology, transport, production, and military enterprises. SoS engineering is challenged by the independence, heterogeneity, evolution, and emergence properties found in SoS. This article focuses on the role of model-based techniques within the SoS engineering field. A review of existing attempts to define and classify SoS is used to identify several dimensions that characterise SoS applications. The SoS field is exemplified by a series of representative systems selected from the literature on SoS applications. Within the area of model-based techniques the survey specifically reviews the state of the art for SoS modelling, architectural description, simulation, verification, and testing. Finally, the identified dimensions of SoS characteristics are used to identify research challenges and future research areas of model-based SoS engineering.
