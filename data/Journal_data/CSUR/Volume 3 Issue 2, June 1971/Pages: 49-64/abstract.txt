Consideration is given to the basic methodology for table searching in computer programming. Only static tables are treated, but references are made to techniques for handling dynamic tables. Methods described are: sequential search, merge search, binary search, estimated entry, and direct entry. The rationale of key transformation is discussed, with some consideration of methods of “hash addressing.” A general guide to technique selection is given in conclusion.
