The use of static random access memory (SRAM)-based field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) in harsh radiation environments has grown in recent years. These types of programmable devices require special mitigation techniques targeting the configuration memory, the user logic, and the embedded RAM blocks. This article provides a comprehensive survey of the literature published in this rich research field during the past 10 years. Furthermore, it can also serve as a tutorial for space engineers, scientists, and decision makers who need an introduction to this topic.
