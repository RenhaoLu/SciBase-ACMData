Web applications are one of the most prevalent platforms for information and service delivery over the Internet today. As they are increasingly used for critical services, web applications have become a popular and valuable target for security attacks. Although a large body of techniques have been developed to fortify web applications and mitigate attacks launched against them, there has been little effort devoted to drawing connections among these techniques and building the big picture of web application security research.This article surveys the area of securing web applications from the server side, with the aim of systematizing the existing techniques into a big picture that promotes future research. We first present the unique aspects of the web application development that cause inherent challenges in building secure web applications. We then discuss three commonly seen security vulnerabilities within web applications:input validation vulnerabilities, session management vulnerabilities, andapplication logic vulnerabilities, along with attacks that exploit these vulnerabilities. We organize the existing techniques along two dimensions: (1) the security vulnerabilities and attacks that they address and (2) the design objective and the phases of a web application during which they can be carried out. These phases aresecure construction of new web applications, security analysis/testing of legacy web applications, andruntime protection of legacy web applications. Finally, we summarize the lessons learned and discuss future research opportunities in this area.
