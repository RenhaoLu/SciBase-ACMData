This is a survey of a data structures and their use in computer graphics systems. First, the reasons for using data structures are given. Then the sequential, random, and list organizations are discussed, and it is shown how they may be used to build complex data structures. Representative samples of languages specifically designed for creating and manipulating data structures are described next. Finally some typical computer graphics systems and their data structures are described. It is also pointed out that much work remains to be done to develop a satisfactory theoretical foundation for designing data structures.
