This article presents our research towards developing novel and fundamental methodologies for data representation using spike-timing-dependent encoding. Time encoding efficiently maps a signal's amplitude information into a spike time sequence that represents the input data and offers perfect recovery for band-limited stimuli. In this article, we pattern the neural activities across multiple timescales and encode the sensory information using time-dependent temporal scales. The spike encoding methodologies for autonomous classification of time-series signatures are explored using near-chaotic reservoir computing. The proposed spiking neuron is compact, low power, and robust. A hardware implementation of these results is expected to produce an agile hardware implementation of time encoding as a signal conditioner for dynamical neural processor designs.
