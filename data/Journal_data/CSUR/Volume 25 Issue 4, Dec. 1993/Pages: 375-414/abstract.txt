The security of information systems is a serious issue because computer abuse is increasing. It is important, therefore, that systems analysts and designers develop expertise in methods for specifying information systems security. The characteristics found in three generations of general information system design methods provide a framework for comparing and understanding current security design methods. These methods include approaches that use checklists of controls, divide functional requirements into engineering partitions, and create abstract models of both the problem and the solution. Comparisons and contrasts reveal that advances in security methods lag behind advances in general systems development methods. This analysis also reveals that more general methods fail to consider security specifications rigorously.
