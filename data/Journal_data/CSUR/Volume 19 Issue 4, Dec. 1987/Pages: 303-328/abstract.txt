The problem of deadlock detection in distributed systems has undergone extensive study. An important application relates to distributed database systems. A uniform model in which published algorithms can be cast is given, and the fundamental principles on which distributed deadlock detection schemes are based are presented. These principles represent mechanisms for developing distributed algorithms in general and deadlock detection schemes in particular. In addition, a hierarchy of deadlock models is presented; each model is characterized by the restrictions that are imposed upon the form resource requests can assume. The hierarchy includes the well-known models of resource and communication deadlock. Algorithms are classified according to both the underlying principles and the generality of resource requests they permit. A number of algorithms are discussed in detail, and their complexity in terms of the number of messages employed is compared. The point is made that correctness proofs for such algorithms using operational arguments are cumbersome and error prone and, therefore, that only completely formal proofs are sufficient for demonstrating correctness.
