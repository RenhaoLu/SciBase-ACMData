Most contemporary Web frameworks may be classified as server-centric. An overview of such Web frameworks is presented. It is based on information gleaned from surveying 80 server-centric Web frameworks, as well as from popular related specifications. Requirements typically expected of a server-centric Web framework are discussed. Two Web framework taxonomies are proposed, reflecting two orthogonal ways of characterizing a framework: the way in which the markup language content of a browser-destined document is specified in the framework (presentation concerns); and the framework's facilities for the user to control the flow of events between browser and server (control concerns).
