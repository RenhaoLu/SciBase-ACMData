puter systems Rep. MAC-TR-50, MIT Project MAC. Cambridge, Mass., May 1968. The dynamic allocation of limited processor and main memory resources among the users is investigated in four phases: (1) a model for program behavior is constructed, (2) the properties of system demand are defined and studied, (3) system balance policies are formulated as mathematical programming problems whose solutions are found dynamically by the scheduler, (4) these ideas are applied to the design and administration of multiprocess computer systems.

ment. J. ACM 13, 2 (Apr. 1967), 242-261. "Ideal" (i.e. zero overhead and swapping time) RR and externally assigned priority class systems with Poisson arnvals and geometric or exponential service times are studied. Expected response times are derived both m the fimte Q case and the processorshared (i.e. Q --) 0) case.

Oper. Res. 15 (1967), 304-318. A non-time-sharing model is presented in which relative position in tile queue is determined by the size of the customer's bribe. A cost function encompassing the bribe and the cost of waiting is defined and the conditions for an optimal bribing function are then found.

The attained service for an incompletely serviced customer is the number of seconds that he has so far spent in the service facility. In this paper the distribution of attained servwe is found in terms of the average response time.
