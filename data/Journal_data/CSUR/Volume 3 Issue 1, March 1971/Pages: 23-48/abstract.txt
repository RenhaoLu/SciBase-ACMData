This paper describes the internal structure of a time-sharing system in some detail. This system is dedicated to providing remote access, and has a simple file structure. It is intended for use in a university type environment where there are many short jobs that will profit from one- or two-second turnaround. Despite its simplicity, this system can serve as a useful introduction to the problems encountered by the designers of any time-sharing system. Included are a discussion of the command language, the hardware organization toward which the design is oriented, the general internal organization, the command sequences, the CPU scheduler, handling of interrupts, the assignment of core space, execution and control of the user's program, backup storage management, and the handling of errors.
