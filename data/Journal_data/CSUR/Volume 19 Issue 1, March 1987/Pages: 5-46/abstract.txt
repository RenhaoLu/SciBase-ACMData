The paper puts information systems (IS) research dealing with IS problems into perspective. IS problems are surveyed and classified. Using the IS research framework suggested by Ives, Hamilton, and Davis, research into IS problems is classified into several perspectives whose relevance in coping with the problems is discussed. Research perspectives focusing on IS operations environment, IS development process, IS development organization, IS development methods, and IS theories are distinguished. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research and how to deal with IS problems in practice.
