Utilizing parallelism at the instruction level is an important way to improve performance. Because the time spent in loop execution dominates total execution time, a large body of optimizations focuses on decreasing the time to execute each iteration. Software pipelining is a technique that reforms the loop so that a faster execution rate is realized. Iterations are executed in overlapped fashion to increase parallelism.Let {ABC}nrepresent a loop containing operationsA, B, Cthat is executedntimes. Although the operations of a single iteration can be parallelized, more parallelism may be achieved if the entire loop is considered rather than a single iteration. The software pipelining transformation utilizes the fact that a loop {ABC}nis equivalent toA{BCA}nâˆ’1BC. Although the operations contained in the loop do not change, the operations are from different iterations of the original loop.Various algorithms for software pipelining exist. A comparison of the alternative methods for software pipelining is presented. The relationships between the methods are explored and possibilities for improvement highlighted.
