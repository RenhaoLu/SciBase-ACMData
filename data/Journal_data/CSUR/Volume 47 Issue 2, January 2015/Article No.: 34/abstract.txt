We review the computation of 3D geometric data mapping, which establishes one-to-one correspondence between or among spatial/spatiotemporal objects. Effective mapping benefits many scientific and engineering tasks that involve the modeling and processing of correlated geometric or image data. We model mapping computation as an optimization problem with certain geometric constraints and go through its general solving pipeline. Different mapping algorithms are discussed and compared according to their formulations of objective functions, constraints, and optimization strategies.
