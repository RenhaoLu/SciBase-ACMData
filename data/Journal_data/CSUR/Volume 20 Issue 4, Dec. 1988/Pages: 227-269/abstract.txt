In computer design, it is essential to know the effectiveness of different design options in improving performance and dependability. Various software tools have been created to evaluate these parameters, applying both analytic and simulation techniques, and this paper reviews those related primarily to reliability, availability, and serviceability. The purpose, type of models used, type of systems modeled, inputs, and outputs are given for each package. Examples of some of the key modeling elements such as Markov chains, fault trees, and Petri nets are discussed. The information is compiled to facilitate recognition of similarities and differences between various models and tools and can be used to aid in selecting models and tools for a particular application or designing tools for future needs. Tools included in the evaluation are CARE-III, ARIES-82, SAVE, MARKl, HARP, SHARPE, GRAMP, SURF, SURE, ASSIST, METASAN, METFAC, ARM, and SUPER. Modeling tools, such as REL70, RELCOMP, CARE, CARSRA, and CAST, that were forerunners to some of the current tools are noted for their contributions. Modeling elements that have gained widespread use for general systems, as well as fault-tolerant systems, are included. Tools capable of modeling both repairable and nonrepairable systems, accepting constant or time varying failure rates, and predicting reliability, availability, and serviceability parameters are surveyed.
