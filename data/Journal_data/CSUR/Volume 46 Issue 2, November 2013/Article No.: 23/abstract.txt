Over the last 20 years research has been done on the question of how egocentric distances, i.e., the subjectively reported distance from a human observer to an object, are perceived in virtual environments. This review surveys the existing literature on empirical user studies on this topic. In summary, there is a mean estimation of egocentric distances in virtual environments of about 74&percnt; of the modeled distances. Many factors possibly influencing distance estimates were reported in the literature. We arranged these factors into four groups, namely measurement methods, technical factors, compositional factors, and human factors. The research on these factors is summarized, conclusions are drawn, and promising areas for future research are outlined.
