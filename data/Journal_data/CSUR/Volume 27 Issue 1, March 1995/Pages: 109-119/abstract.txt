Fringe analysis is a technique used to study the average behavior of search trees. In this paper we survey the main results regarding this technique, and we improve a previous asymptotic theorem. At the same time, we present new developments and applications of the theory that allow improvements in several bounds on the behavior of search trees. Our examples cover binary search trees, AVL-trees, 2â€“3 trees, and B-trees.
