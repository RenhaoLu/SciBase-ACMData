We consider thepoint-to-point (approximate) shortest-path query problem, which is the following generalization of the classicalsingle-source (SSSP)andall-pairs shortest-path (APSP)problems: we are first presented with anetwork (graph). A so-called preprocessing algorithm may compute certain information(a data structure or index)to prepare for the next phase. After this preprocessing step, applications may ask shortest-path or distance queries, which should be answered as fast as possible.Due to its many applications in areas such as transportation, networking, and social science, this problem has been considered by researchers from various communities (sometimes under different names): algorithm engineers construct fast route planning methods; database and information systems researchers investigatematerialization tradeoffs, query processing onspatial networks, andreachability queries; and theoretical computer scientists analyzedistance oraclesandsparse spanners. Related problems are considered forcompact routinganddistance labelingschemes in networking and distributed computing and formetric embeddingsin geometry as well.In this survey, we review selected approaches, algorithms, and results on shortest-path queries from these fields, with the main focus lying on the tradeoff between the index size and the query time. We survey methods for general graphs as well as specialized methods for restricted graph classes, in particular for those classes with arguable practical significance such as planar graphs and complex networks.
