Transport layer protocols provide for end-to-end communication between two or more hosts. This paper presents a tutorial on transport layer concepts and terminology, and a survey of transport layer services and protocols. The transport layer protocol TCP is used as a reference point, and compared and contrasted with nineteen other protocols designed over the past two decades. The service and protocol features of twelve of the most important protocols are summarized in both text and tables.
