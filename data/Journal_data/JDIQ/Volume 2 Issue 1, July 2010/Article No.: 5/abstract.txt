In the last few years, uncertainty management has come to be recognized as a fundamental aspect of data integration. It is now accepted that it may not be possible to remove uncertainty generated during data integration processes and that uncertainty in itself may represent a source of relevant information. Several issues, such as the aggregation of uncertain mappings and the querying of uncertain mediated schemata, have been addressed by applying well-known uncertainty management theories. However, several problems lie unresolved. This article sketches an initial picture of this highly active research area; it details existing works in the light of a homogeneous framework, and identifies and discusses the leading issues awaiting solutions.
