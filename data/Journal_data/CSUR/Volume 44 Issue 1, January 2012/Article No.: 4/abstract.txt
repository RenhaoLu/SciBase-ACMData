The advances in IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) technology enable a new user-centric and interactive TV model, in which context-awareness is promising in making the userâ€™s interaction with the TV dynamic and transparent. Our research interest is how to achieve TV service personalization applying context-awareness to the NGN IPTV architecture. In this article we present the different existing contributions that employ context-awareness to allow interactive services. Some of these contributions directly focus on TV, while others are proposed for specific NGN services. We present a technical analysis for these solutions and give some guidelines for future deployment of personalized IPTV services.
