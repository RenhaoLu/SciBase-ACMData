Software systems have been using "just-in-time" compilation (JIT) techniques since the 1960s. Broadly, JIT compilation includes any translation performed dynamically, after a program has started execution. We examine the motivation behind JIT compilation and constraints imposed on JIT compilation systems, and present a classification scheme for such systems. This classification emerges as we survey forty years of JIT work, from 1960--2000.
