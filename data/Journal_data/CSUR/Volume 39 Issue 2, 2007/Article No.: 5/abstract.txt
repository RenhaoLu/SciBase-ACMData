In this article, we review the algorithms for rotation, scaling and translation (RST) invariant image watermarking. There are mainly two categories of RST invariant image watermarking algorithms. One is to rectify the RST transformed image before conducting watermark detection. Another is to embed and detect watermark in an RST invariant or semi-invariant domain. In order to help readers understand, we first introduce the fundamental theories and techniques used in the existing RST invariant image watermarking algorithms. Then, we discuss in detail the work principles, embedding process, and detection process of the typical RST invariant image watermarking algorithms. Finally, we analyze and evaluate these typical algorithms through implementation, and point out their advantages and disadvantages.
