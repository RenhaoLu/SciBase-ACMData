Companies acquire personal information from phone, World Wide Web, or email in order to sell or send an advertisement about their product. However, when this information is acquired, moved, copied, or edited, the data may lose its quality. Often, the use of data administrators or a tool that has limited capabilities to correct the mistyped information can cause many problems. Moreover, most of the correction techniques are particularly implemented for the words used in daily conversations. Since personal names have different characteristics compared to general text, a hybrid matching algorithm (PNRS) which employs phonetic encoding, string matching and statistical facts to provide a possible candidate for misspelled names is developed. At the end, the efficiency of the proposed algorithm is compared with other well known spelling correction techniques.
