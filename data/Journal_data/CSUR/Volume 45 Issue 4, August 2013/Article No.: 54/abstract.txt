Resource discovery is an important part of distributed computing and resource sharing systems, like grids and utility computing. Because of the increasing importance of decentralized and peer-to-peer environments, characterized by high dynamism and churn, a number of resource discovery mechanisms, mainly based on peer-to-peer techniques, have been presented recently. We present and classify them according to criteria like their topology and the degree of achievement of various common requirements of great importance for the targeted environments, as well as compare their reported performance. These classifications intend to provide an intuitive vision of the strengths and weaknesses of each system.
