The common features of third generation operating systems are surveyed from a general view, with emphasis on the common abstractions that constitute at least the basis for a “theory” of operating systems. Properties of specific systems are not discussed except where examples are useful. The technical aspects of issues and concepts are stressed, the nontechnical aspects mentioned only briefly. A perfunctory knowledge of third generation systems is presumed.
