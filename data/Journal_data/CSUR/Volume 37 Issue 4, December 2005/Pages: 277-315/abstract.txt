Medical information systems today store clinical information about patients in all kinds of proprietary formats. To address the resulting interoperability problems, several Electronic Healthcare Record standards that structure the clinical content for the purpose of exchange are currently under development. In this article, we present a survey of the most relevant Electronic Healthcare Record standards, examine the level of interoperability they provide, and assess their functionality in terms of content structure, access services, multimedia support, and security. We further investigate the complementarity of the standards and assess their market relevance.
