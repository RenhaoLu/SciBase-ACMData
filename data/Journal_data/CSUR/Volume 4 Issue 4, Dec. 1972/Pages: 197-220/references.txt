BJCRNER, DINES. "Finite state automatondefinition of data communication line control procedures." in Proc. AFIPS FJCC 1970 Vol. 37, AFIPS Press, Montvale, N.J., 477-491. Presents state-transition logic techniques and various methods of their implementation as programs, microprograms and finite-state sequential machines. Shows how state-transition diagrams can be methodically expanded to any desired level of detail.
