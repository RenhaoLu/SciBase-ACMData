Efficient processing of top-kqueries is a crucial requirement in many interactive environments that involve massive amounts of data. In particular, efficient top-kprocessing in domains such as the Web, multimedia search, and distributed systems has shown a great impact on performance. In this survey, we describe and classify top-kprocessing techniques in relational databases. We discuss different design dimensions in the current techniques including query models, data access methods, implementation levels, data and query certainty, and supported scoring functions. We show the implications of each dimension on the design of the underlying techniques. We also discuss top-kqueries in XML domain, and show their connections to relational approaches.
