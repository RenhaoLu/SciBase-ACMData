For years computer-based stochastic simulation has been a commonly used tool in the performance evaluation of various systems. Unfortunately, the results of simulation studies quite often have little credibility, since they are presented without regard to their random nature and the need for proper statistical analysis of simulation output data.This paper discusses the main factors that can affect the accuracy of stochastic simulations designed to give insight into the steady-state behavior of queuing processes. The problems of correctly starting and stopping such simulation experiments to obtain the required statistical accuracy of the results are addressed. In this survey of possible solutions, the emphasis is put on possible applications in the sequential analysis of output data, which adaptively decides about continuing a simulation experiment until the required accuracy of results is reached. A suitable solution for deciding upon the starting point of a steady-state analysis and two techniques for obtaining the final simulation results to a required level of accuracy are presented, together with pseudocode implementations.
