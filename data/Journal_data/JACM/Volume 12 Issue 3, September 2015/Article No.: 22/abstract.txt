With the increase in process variations and diversity in workloads, it is imperative to holistically explore optimization techniques for power and temperature from the circuit layer right up to the compiler/operating system(OS) layer. This article proposes one such holistic technique, calledproactive workload aware temperature management framework for low-power chip multi-processors(ProWATCh). At the compiler level ProWATCh includes two techniques: (1) a novel compiler design for estimating the architectural parameters of a task at compile time; and (2) a model-based technique for dynamic estimation of architectural parameters at runtime. At the OS level ProWATCh integrates two techniques: (1) a workload- and temperature-aware process manager for dynamic distribution of tasks to different cores; and (2) a model predictive control-based task scheduler for generating the efficient sequence of task execution. At the circuit level ProWATCh implements either of two techniques: (1) a workload-aware voltage manager for dynamic supply and body bias voltage assignment for a given frequency in processors that supportadaptive body bias(ABB); or (2) a workload-aware frequency governor for efficient assignment of upper and lower frequency bounds for frequency scaling in processors that do not support an ABB. Employing ProWATCh (with voltage manager) on an ABB-compatible 3D OpenSPARC architecture usingMiBenchbenchmarks resulted in an average18&percnt;(19ˆC) reduction in peak temperature. Evaluating ProWATCh on an existing quad-core Intel Corei7 processor with frequency governor alone (as the processor does not support an ABB interface) resulted in10&percnt;(8ˆC) reduction in peak temperature when compared to what was obtained using the native Linux 3.0completely fair scheduler(CFS). To study the effectiveness of the proposed framework across benchmark suites, ProWATCh was evaluated on a quad-core Intel Corei7 processor usingCPU SPEC 2006benchmarks which resulted in7ˆCreduction in peak temperature as compared to the native Linux 3.0 CFS.
