In the context of distributed databases (DDBs), the absence of mathematically well defined equations to evaluate quality of service (QoS), especially with statistical models, seems to have taken database community attention from the possible performance guarantees that could be handled by concepts related to quality of experience (QoE). In this article, we targeted the definition of QoE based on completeness of QoS to deal with decisions concerning with performance correction in a system level. This study also presents a statistical bibliometric analysis before the proposed model. The idea was to show the origin of first studies with correlated focus, which also have initial conceptualizations, and then propose a new model. This model concerns concise QoS definitions, grouped to provide a basis for QoE analysis. Afterward, it is foreseen that a DDB system will be able to autoevaluate and be aware of recovering situations before they happen.
