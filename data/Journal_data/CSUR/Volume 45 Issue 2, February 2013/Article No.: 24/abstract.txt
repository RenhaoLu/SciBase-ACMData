A local algorithm is a distributed algorithm that runs in constant time, independently of the size of the network. Being highly scalable and fault tolerant, such algorithms are ideal in the operation of large-scale distributed systems. Furthermore, even though the model of local algorithms is very limited, in recent years we have seen many positive results for nontrivial problems. This work surveys the state-of-the-art in the field, covering impossibility results, deterministic local algorithms, randomized local algorithms, and local algorithms for geometric graphs.
