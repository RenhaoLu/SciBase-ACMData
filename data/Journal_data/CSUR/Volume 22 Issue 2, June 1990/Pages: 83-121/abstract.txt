Closed queueing networks are frequently used to model complex service systems such as production systems, communication systems, computer systems, and flexible manufacturing systems. When limitations are imposed on the queue sizes (i.e., finite queues), a phenomenon calledblockingoccurs. Queueing networks with blocking are, in general, difficult to treat. Exact closed form solutions have been reported only in a few special cases. Hence, most of the techniques that are used to analyze such queueing networks are in the form of approximations, numerical analysis, and simulation. In this paper, we give a systematic presentation of the literature related to closed queueing networks with finite queues. The results are significant for both researchers and practitioners.
