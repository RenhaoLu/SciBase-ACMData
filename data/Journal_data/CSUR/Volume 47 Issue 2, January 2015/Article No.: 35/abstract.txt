Case-based planning (CBP) is an approach to automated planning that tries to save computational effort by reusing previously found solutions. In 2001, Spalazzi published a survey of work in CBP; here, we present an updated overview of systems that have contributed to the evolution of the field or addressed some issues related to planning by reuse in a novel way. The article presents relevant planners so that readers gain insight into the operation of these systems. This analysis will allow readers to understand the approaches both in the quality of the solutions and in the complexity of finding them.
