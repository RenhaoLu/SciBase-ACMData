We review the existing literature on Java safety, emphasizing formal approaches, and the impact of Java safety on small footprint devices such as smartcards. The conclusion is that although a lot of good work has been done, a more concerted effort is needed to build a coherent set of machine-readable formal models of the whole of Java and its implementation. This is a formidable task but we believe it is essential to build trust in Java safety, and thence to achieve ITSEC level 6 or Common Criteria level 7 certification for Java programs.
