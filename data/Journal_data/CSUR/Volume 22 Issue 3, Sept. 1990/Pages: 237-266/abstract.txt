It is increasingly important for organizations to achieve additional coordination of diverse computerized operations. To do so, it is necessary to have database systems that can operate over a distributed network and can encompass a heterogeneous mix of computers, operating systems, communications links, and local database management systems. This paper outlines approaches to various aspects of heterogeneous distributed data management and describes the characteristics and architectures of seven existing heterogeneous distributed database systems developed for production use. The objective is a survey of the state of the art in systems targeted for production environments as opposed to research prototypes.
