Mazur v. Stein, 347 U.S. 201 (1954). The Supreme Court stated: "We find nothing in the copyright statute to support the argument that the intended use in industry of an article ehglble for copyright bars or invahdates its registration. We do not read such limitation into the copyright law."
Addison-Wesley Publishing Co. v. Brown, 207 F.Supp. 678, 233 F.Supp. 219 (E.D.N.Y. 1963). Preparation and pubhcation of a derivative book contaimng answers to physics problems in copyrighted book held to be an infringement. Court noted that the offending book could be taken as a manner of "translation" of the source, as the plaintiffs argued, but the decision of infringement was rendered on the broader ground that "unfair use has been made by the defendants of the product of the plaintiff's original and useful work," and thus the defense of "fair use" was rejected. This decision contains revealing discussion of the transformations or the "making of other versions" of the content of a technical work.

Gottschalk v. Benson 409 U.S. 63, 175 U S P.Q. 673 (1972). The US Supreme Court considered an appeal of an application for patent for a method of decimal to binary conversmn conducted inside a computer. The Court called the method a computer program or a formula, and then denied a patent saying that such a patent "would wholly preempt the mathematical formula and in practical effect would be a patent on the algorithm itself." Two years later a lower court (Court of Customs and Patent Appeals), in the case of In Re Johnston 183 U.S.P.Q 172 (1974), despite this Supreme Court decision, granted a patent by a 3-2 decision to an accounting system invention which is descmbed by means of a computer program. Because of the present confused state of the law, ~t is difficult to predict the future course of patentability of computer software.
