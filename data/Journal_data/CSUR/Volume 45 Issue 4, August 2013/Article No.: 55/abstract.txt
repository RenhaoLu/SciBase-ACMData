Organizations perceive ERP as a vital tool for organizational competition as it integrates dispersed organizational systems and enables flawless transactions and production. This review examines studies investigating Critical Success Factors (CSFs) in implementing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Keywords relating to the theme of this study were defined and used to search known Web engines and journal databases for studies on both implementing ERP systems per se and integrating ERP systems with other well- known systems (e.g., SCM, CRM) whose importance to business organizations and academia is acknowledged to work in a complementary fashion. A total of 341 articles were reviewed to address three main goals. This study structures previous research by presenting a comprehensive taxonomy of CSFs in the area of ERP. Second, it maps studies, identified through an exhaustive and comprehensive literature review, to different dimensions and facets of ERP system implementation. Third, it presents studies investigating CSFs in terms of a specific ERP lifecycle phase and across the entire ERP life cycle. This study not only reviews articles in which an ERP system is the sole or primary field of research, but also articles that refer to an integration of ERP systems and other popular systems (e.g., SCM, CRM). Finally it provides a comprehensive bibliography of the articles published during this period that can serve as a guide for future research.
