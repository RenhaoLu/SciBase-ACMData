This research develops a data quality algorithm entitled the Accuracy Assessment Algorithm (AAA). This is an extension of research in developing an enhancement to a Bayesian Network (BN) learning algorithm called the Data Quality (DQ) algorithm. This new algorithm is concerned with estimating the accuracy levels of a dataset by assessing the quality of the data with no prior knowledge of the dataset. The AAA and associated metrics were tested using two canonical BNs and one large-scale medical network. The article presents the results regarding the efficacy of the algorithm and the implications for future research and practice.
