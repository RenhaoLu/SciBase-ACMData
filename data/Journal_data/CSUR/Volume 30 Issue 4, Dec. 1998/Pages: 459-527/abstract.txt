This article surveys techniques used in structured and object-oriented software specification methods. The techniques are classified as techniques for the specification of external interaction and internal decomposition.  The external specification techniques are further subdivided into techniques for the specification of functions, behavior, and communication. After surveying the techniques, we summarize the way they are used in structured and object-oriented methods and indicate ways in which they can be combined. This article ends with a plea for simplicity in diagram techniques and for the use of formal semantics to define these techniques. The appendices show how the reviewed techniques are used in 6 structured and 19 object-oriented specification methods.
