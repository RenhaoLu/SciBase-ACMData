The ACM Special Interest Group on the Management of Data (formerly named the Special Interest Group on File Description and Translation) holds an annum Conference. The Proceedings of these conferences are available from ACM, New York.
A Special Working Conference, "An In-Depth Evaluation of Codasyl DDL," was held in Belgium in January 1975. Proceedings of that conference are available in the book Database Description, B.C.M. Douque and G. M. Nijssen, Eds. North-Holland Publ. Co., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 1975.
