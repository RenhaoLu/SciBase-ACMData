In this article we present a comprehensive survey of various approaches for the verification of cache coherence protocols based onstate enumeration, (symbolic model checking, andsymbolic state models. Since these techniques search the state space of the protocol exhaustively, the amount of memory required to manipulate that state information and the verification time grow very fast with the number of processors and the complexity of the protocol mechanisms. To be successful for systems of arbitrary complexity, a verification technique must solve this so-calledstate space explosionproblem. The emphasis of our discussion is onthe underlying theory in each method of handling the state space exposion problem, and formulationg and checking thesafetyproperties (e.g., data consistency) and thelivenessproperties (absence of deadlock and livelock). We compare the efficiency and discuss the limitations of each technique in terms of memory and computation time. Also, we discuss issues ofgenerality, applicability, automaticity, and amenityfor existing tools in each class of methods. No method is truly superior because each method has its own strengths and weaknesses. Finally, refinements that can further reduce the verification time and/or the memory requirement are also discussed.
