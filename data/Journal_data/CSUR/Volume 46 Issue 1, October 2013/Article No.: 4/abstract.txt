The first steps in analyzing defensive malware are understanding what obfuscations are present in real-world malware binaries, how these obfuscations hinder analysis, and how they can be overcome. While some obfuscations have been reported independently, this survey consolidates the discussion while adding substantial depth and breadth to it. This survey also quantifies the relative prevalence of these obfuscations by using the Dyninst binary analysis and instrumentation tool that was recently extended for defensive malware analysis. The goal of this survey is to encourage analysts to focus on resolving the obfuscations that are most prevalent in real-world malware.
