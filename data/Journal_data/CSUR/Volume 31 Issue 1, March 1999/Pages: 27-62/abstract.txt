Deductive databases result from the integration of relational database and logic programming techniques. However, significant problems remain inherent in this simple synthesis from the language point of view. In this paper, we discuss these problems from four different aspects: complex values, object orientation, higher-orderness, and updates. In each case, we examine four typical languages that address the corresponding issues.
