Modes of human-computer interaction in the control of dynamic
systems are discussed, and the problem of allocating tasks between
human and computer considered. Models of human performance in a
variety of tasks associated with the control of dynamic systems are
reviewed. These models are evaluated in the context of a design
example involving human-computer interaction in aircraft
operations. Other examples include power plants, chemical plants,
and ships.
