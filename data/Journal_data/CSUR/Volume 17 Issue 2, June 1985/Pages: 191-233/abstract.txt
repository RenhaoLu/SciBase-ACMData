Computer music is a relatively new field. While a large proportion of the public is aware of computer music in one form or another, there seems to be a need for a better understanding of its capabilities and limitations in terms of synthesis, performance, and recording hardware. This article addresses that need by surveying and discussing the architecture of existing computer music systems.System requirements vary according to what the system will be used for. Common uses for computer music systems include composition, performance, research, home entertainment, and studio recording/mixing. This paper outlines system components with this wide diversity of possible uses in mind.Current synthesis and analysis techniques, and the different way in which these  techniques can be implemented in special-purpose hardware, are comprehensively reviewed. Design specifications are given for certain digital-to-analog (and analog-to-digital) converters, disk interfaces, system organization, control hardware and software, and numerical precision.Several synthesis systems are described in detail, with an emphasis on theoretical developments and innovative design. Commercial synthesizers and other architectures are also briefly mentioned.
