This tutorial discusses Householder reduction ofnlinear equations to a triangular
form which can be solved by back substitution. The main strength of the
method is its unconditional numerical stability. We explain how
Householder reduction can be derived from elementary-matrix algebra. The
method is illustrated by a numerical example and a Pascal procedure. We
assume that the reader has a general knowledge of vector and matrix
algebra but is less familiar with linear transformation of a vector
space.â€”Author's Abstract
