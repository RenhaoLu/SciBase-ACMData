Three major purposes for evaluating the hardware and software
performance of computer systems--selection evaluation, performance
projection, and performance monitoring--are described. Eight
techniques that have been used or suggested for evaluating
performance are discussed. Each of these techniques is rated on its
suitability for the three purposes of evaluation. Recommendations
are made on the most appropriate technique for each evaluation
purpose. These suggestions include the development of a
comprehensive set of synthetic programs on an industry-wide basis
for selection evaluation purposes. Simulation is recommended as the
most suitable technique for performance projection. Finally, a
number of hardware and software monitors are available for
performance monitoring.
