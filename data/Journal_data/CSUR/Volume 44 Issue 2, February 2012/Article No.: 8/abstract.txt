Collaborative systems evaluation is always necessary to determine the impact a solution will have on the individuals, groups, and the organization. Several methods of evaluation have been proposed. These methods comprise a variety of approaches with various goals. Thus, the need for a strategy to select the most appropriate method for a specific case is clear. This research work presents a detailed framework to evaluate collaborative systems according to given variables and performance levels. The proposal assumes that evaluation is an evolving process during the system lifecycle. Therefore, the framework, illustrated with two examples, is complemented with a collection of guidelines to evaluate collaborative systems according to product development status.
