The goal in computer vision systems is to analyze data collected from the environment and derive an interpretation to complete a specified task. Vision system tasks may be divided into data acquisition, low-level processing, representation, model construction, and matching subtasks. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of model-based vision systems using dense-range images. A comprehensive survey of the recent publications in each subtask pertaining to dense-range image object recognition is presented.
