The emergence of new Internet paradigms has changed the common properties of network data, increasing the bandwidth consumption and balancing traffic in both directions. These facts raise important challenges, making it necessary to devise effective solutions for managing network traffic. Since traditional methods are rather ineffective and easily bypassed, particular attention has been paid to the development of new approaches for traffic classification. This article surveys the studies on peer-to-peer traffic detection and classification, making an extended review of the literature. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive analysis of the concepts and strategies for network monitoring.
