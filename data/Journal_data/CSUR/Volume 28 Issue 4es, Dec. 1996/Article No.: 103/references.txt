I am in fact lumping together a wide range of approaches to introductory computation. (See, for example, (Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman, 1985; ACM, 1991; Connor, Niguidula, and van Dam, 1995; Roberts, 1995) for a variety of different course curricula.) Although there are many variants, with significant pedagogic and curricular distinctions, the single-thread-of-control sequentialist paradigm is virtually universal.
This has not in fact been true for decades (since the advent of the timesharing system), but until sometime in the 1980s most applications programs subscribed to the pretense of a single thread. Increasingly, however, students laboring under this illusion must first be retrained to deal with the realities of embedded multithreaded computation before they can appreciate the worlds of applications programming or advanced computer science.
