Semantic data models have emerged from a requirement for more expressive conceptual data models. Current generation data models lack direct support for relationships, data abstraction, inheritance, constraints, unstructured objects, and the dynamic properties of an application. Although the need for data models with richer semantics is widely recognized, no single approach has won general acceptance. This paper describes the generic properties of semantic data models and presents a representative selection of models that have been proposed since the mid-1970s. In addition to explaining the features of the individual models, guidelines are offered for the comparison of models. The paper concludes with a discussion of future directions in the area of conceptual data modeling.
