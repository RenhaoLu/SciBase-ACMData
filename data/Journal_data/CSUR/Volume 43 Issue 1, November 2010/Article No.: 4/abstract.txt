Requirements capture is arguably the most important step in software engineering, and yet the most difficult and the least formalized one [Phalp and Shepperd 2000]. Enterprises build information systems to support theirbusiness processes. Software engineering research has typically focused on the development process, starting with user requirements—if that—with business modeling often confused with software system modeling [Isoda 2001]. Researchers and practitioners in management information systems have long recognized that understanding the business processes that an information system must support is key to eliciting the needs of its users (see e.g., Eriksson and Penker 2000]), but lacked the tools to model such business processes or to relate such models to software requirements. Researchers and practitioners in business administration have long been interested in modeling the processes of organizations for the purposes of understanding, analyzing, and improving such processes [Hammer and Champy 1993], but their models were often too coarse to be of use to software engineers. The advent of ecommerce and workflow management systems, among other things, has led to a convergence of interests and tools, within the broad IT community, for modeling and enabling business processes. In this article we present an overview of business process modeling languages. We first propose a categorization of the various languages and then describe representative languages from each family.
