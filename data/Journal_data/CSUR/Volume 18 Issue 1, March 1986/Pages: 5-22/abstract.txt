The high-level languages proposed for supercomputers, such as vector and array processors, have been designed using one of the following two approaches: (1) an existing sequential language is adapted, (2) a new language based on the hardware is developed. Recently, there has emerged a third approach, which does not require the programmer to be aware of the sequential nature of the language or the hardware characteristics.Examples of these language groups are examined to illustrate their main features and what is required of a programmer when using such languages. The study therefore enables a comparison of the different language approaches to be made.
