This article surveys previous work on program slicing-based techniques. For each technique, we describe its features, its main applications, and a common example of slicing using such a technique. After discussing each technique separately, all of them are compared in order to clarify and establish the relations between them. This comparison gives rise to a classification of techniques which can help to guide future research directions in this field.
