The continuous development of wireless networks and mobile devices has motivated an intense research in mobile data services. Some of these services provide the user with context-aware information. Specifically, location-based services and location-dependent queries have attracted a lot of interest.In this article, the existing literature in the field of location-dependent query processing is reviewed. The technological context (mobile computing) and support middleware (such as moving object databases and data stream technology) are described, location-based services and location-dependent queries are defined and classified, and different query processing approaches are reviewed and compared.
