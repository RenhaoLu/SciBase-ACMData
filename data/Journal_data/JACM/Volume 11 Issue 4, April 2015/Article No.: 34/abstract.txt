Scaling down beyond CMOS transistors requires the combination of new computing paradigms and novel devices. In this context, neuromorphic architecture is developed to achieve robust and ultra-low power computing systems. Memristive nanodevices are often associated with this architecture to implement efficiently synapses for ultra-high density. In this article, we investigate the design of a neuro-inspired logic block (NLB) dedicated to on-chip function learning and propose learning strategy. It is composed of an array of memristive nanodevices as synapses associated to neuronal circuits. Supervised learning methods are proposed for different type of memristive nanodevices and simulations are performed to demonstrate the ability to learn logic functions with memristive nanodevices. Benefiting from a compact implementation of neuron circuits and the optimization of learning process, this architecture requires small number of nanodevices and moderate power consumption.
