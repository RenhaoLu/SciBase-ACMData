Autonomous authoring tools are routinely used to expedite the translation of large document collections into functioning hypertexts. They are also used to add hyperlinks to pre-existing hypertext structures. In this survey we describe a taxonomy of autonomous hypertext authoring tools. The classification of any given system is determined by the type and nature of the document analysis it performs.
