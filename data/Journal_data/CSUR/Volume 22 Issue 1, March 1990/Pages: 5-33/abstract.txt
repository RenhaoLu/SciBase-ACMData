This paper presents an overview of deterministic functional RAM chip testing. Instead of the traditional ad-hoc approach toward developing memory test algorithms, a hierarchy of functional faults and tests is presented, which is shown to cover all likely functional memory faults. This is done by presenting a novel way of categorizing the faults. All (possible) fault combinations are discussed. Requirements are put forward under which conditions a fault combination can be detected. Finally, memory test algorithms that satisfy the given requirements are presented.
