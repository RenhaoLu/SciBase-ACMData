The relationship between data accuracy and the resulting information accuracy is of great interest in numerous problem domains. An understanding of this relationship can improve the efficiency of data management and increase the accuracy and utility of information in problem-solving settings. Nonetheless, our understanding of that relationship is still partial. In fact, even the sign of the relationship is not well understood. Nearly all researchers have embraced the popular belief in GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out), which indicates a strong positive link between input accuracy and output accuracy. However, there is evidence that hints to a more complex association. This article addresses the relationship between input accuracy and output accuracy, particularly the sign of that relationship, in satisficing decisions that apply a conjunctive or disjunctive rule for combining selected criteria. Analysis of a simple scenario shows a surprising result: the sign of that relationship varies; higher input accuracy can lead to lower output accuracy. This article derives criteria that determine the sign of the relationship and explains and illustrates conditions in which the sign is negative. The findings of this research imply certain rules for guiding data quality management resource allocation and design decisions in similar scenarios.
