This article surveys probablistic approaches to modeling information retrieval. The basic concepts of probabilistic approaches to information retrieval are outlined and the principles and assumptions upon which the approaches are based are presented. The various models proposed in the development of IR are described, classified, and compared using a common formalism. New approaches that constitute the basis of future research are described.
