The rising abuse of computers and increasing threat to personal privacy through data banks have stimulated much interest in the technical safeguards for data. There are four kinds of safeguards, each related to but distinct from the others. Access controls regulate which users may enter the system and subsequently which data sets an active user may read or write. Flow controls regulate the dissemination of values among the data sets accessible to a user. Inference controls protect statistical databases by preventing questioners from deducing confidential information by posing carefully designed sequences of statistical queries and correlating the responses. Statistical data banks are much less secure than most people believe. Data encryption attempts to prevent unauthorized disclosure of confidential information in transit or in storage. This paper describes the general nature of controls of each type, the kinds of problems they can and cannot solve, and their inherent limitations and weaknesses. The paper is intended for a general audience with little background in the area.
