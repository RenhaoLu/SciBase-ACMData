Database systems were a solution to the problem of shared access to heterogeneous files created by multiple autonomous applications in a centralized environment. To make data usage easier, the files were replaced by a globally integrated database. To a large extent, the idea was successful, and many databases are now accessible through local and long-haul networks. Unavoidably, users now need shared access to multiple autonomous databases. The question is what the corresponding methodology should be. Should one reapply the database approach to create globally integrated distributed database systems or should a new approach be introduced?We argue for a new approach to solving such data management system problems, calledmultidatabaseorfederatedsystems. These systems make databases interoperable, that is, usable without a globally integrated schema. They preserve the autonomy of each database yet support shared access.Systems of this type will be of major importance in the future. This paper first discusses why this is the case. Then, it presents methodologies for their design. It further shows that major commerical relational database systems are evolving toward multidatabase systems. The paper discusses their capabilities and limitations, presents and discusses a set of prototypes, and, finally, presents some current research issues.
