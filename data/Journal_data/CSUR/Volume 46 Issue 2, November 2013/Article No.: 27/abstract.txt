Distance learning, electronic learning, and mobile learning offer content, methods, and technologies that decrease the limitations of traditional education. Mobile learning (m-learning) is an extension of distance education, supported by mobile devices equipped with wireless technologies. It is an emerging learning model and process that requires new forms of teaching, learning, contents, and dynamics between actors. In order to ascertain the current state of knowledge and research, an extensive review of the literature in m-learning has been undertaken to identify and harness potential factors and gaps in implementation. This article provides a critical analysis of m-learning projects and related literature, presenting the findings of this aforementioned analysis. It seeks to facilitate the inquiry into the following question: “What is possible in m-learning using recent technologies&quest;” The analysis will be divided into two main parts: applications from the recent online mobile stores and operating system standalone applications.
