CHANDY, J. AND REDDY, A. L. N. 1993. Failure evaluation of disk array organizations. In Proceedmgs of the International Conference on Distrtbuted Computing Systems. IEEE Computer Society, Washington, D.C. Contrasts four previously described schemes for minimizing data reconstruction time in small (7 and 16 disks) redundant disk arrays: RAID 5 with a single spare disk, RAID 5 with a single spare whose space is distributed across all disks, a special case of Muntz and Lui's parity-clustering organization, and a method of dynamically converting a redundant data disk to a spare disk by merging two redundancy groups into one larger group. The second, distributed sparing, is generally preferred because of its performance and simplicity, but the Muntz scheme is better for minimal impact of user performance during recovery.

Bounds are used to model the quemng and fork-join synchronization in RAID level-1 disk arrays. Small write requests in RAID level-5 disk arrays are handled by ignoring the fork-join synchromzatlon overhead. Large requests are modcled by using a single queue for all the disks m the disk array.

Simulation showed significant benefits from intelligent caching but not from readahead which delayed demand requests since it was not preemptable.

MENON, J., MATTSON, D., AND NO, S. 1991. Distributed sparing for improved performance of disk arrays. Tech Rep. RJ 7943, IBM, Almaden Research Center. Explores the use of an on-line spare disk in a redundant disk array analytically It examines multiple configurations, but fundamentally it distributes the spare's space over the whole array so that every disk is N/(N + 2) data, 1/(N + 2) parity, and 1/(N + 2) spare. This gives an extra 1/(N + 2) performance, but, more significantly, it distributes the recovery-write load (the reconstructed data) over all disks to shorten recovery time. The benefits, not surprisingly, are largest for small arrays.

MERCHANT, A. AND Yu, P. 1992. Design and modeling of clustered RAID. In Proceedings of the International Symposium on Fault Tolerant Computing. IEEE Computer Society, Washington, D.C., 140 149. Presents an implementation of parity declustering, which the authors call "clustered RAID," based on random permutations. Its advantage is that it ~s able to derive a data mapping for any size disk array with any size parity stripe, and the corresponding disadvantage is that the computational requirements of the mapping algorithm are high compared to the block-design-based approaches. Analyzes response time and reconstruction time using this technique via an analytic model, and finds substantial benefits m bath.
