Ben-Or and Linial consider the problem of obtaining a distributed coin toss, where each node is initially assigned either a head or a tail. The outcome of the distributed coin toss should not be affected by bias at individual nodes. To exclude the obvious trivial solution where each nonfaulty node picks a predetermined value, it is required that if every node changes its initial value, the result of the distributed coin toss should also change. An efficient solution is obtained under the assumption that unfair (faulty) nodes have complete knowledge of actions taken by all nodes.

In Proceedings of the 33rd Annual IEEE Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science. IEEE, New York, 197 207. In a }~-aerver problem, each server is at some point in a metric space. At each time step, a request arises. Each request is a point in metric space and must be serviced by moving one of the k servers to the point specified. The cost associated with the request is the distance that the server moves. The competitive ratio of a k-server system is the worst-case ratio of the cost of an interactive algorithm on a sequence of inputs, to the optimal cost that would be incurred if the entire sequence were known in advance. The paper proves a lower bound of ll(~/log k/loglog k ) for the competitive ratio of a k-server system assuming an oblivious adversary. This improves on the previously known bound of i)(loglog k).

This paper solves the problem of generating a spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph G which has the following special property: it is chosen uniformly at random from all possible spanning trees of G. The expected running time of the probabilistic algorithm is O(n log n) per generated tree for almost all graphs. It can be O(n3) per generated tree in the worst case.

CHAZELLE, B. AND FRIEDMAN, J. 1990. A deterministic view of random sampling and its use in geometry. Combinatorica 10, 3, 229-249. Using techniques due to Lov~sz and Spencer, the authors present a unified framework for derandomizing probabilistic algorithms that resort to repeated random sampling over a fixed domain. In the process, they establish results of independent interest concernmg the covering of hypergraphs. Specifically, via a modification of Lov~sz's greedy cover algortthm, they give an algorithm that, given a hypergraph with n vertices and m edges, each of size >_ an, computes an r-sample that intersects every edge e of the hypergraph in ll(le{r/n) vertices, where r = O((log n + log m)/c~ ). This improves upon Lov~sz's algorithm in terms of the number of covered vertices. The tools they use for computing covers "are powerful enough to derandomize just about every probabilistic algorithm proposed in computational geometry."

One computes the skeleton of a simple polygon and the other the Delaunay triangulation of a set of points knowing the euclidean minimum spanning tree. The existence of deterministic O(n log n) algorithms for both problems is an open problem.

In Proceedings of the 31st Annual IEEE Sympostum on the Foundations of Computer Science. IEEE, New York, 308-317. The following two problems posed in De Santis et al. {1988}, associated with noninteractive zero-knowledge proof systems, are solved: (1) how to construct NIZK proofs under general complexity assumptions rather than number-theoretic assumptions and (2) how to enable multiple provers to prove, in writing, polynomially many theorems based on a single random string. The authors show that any number of provers can share the same random string and that any trap-door permutation can be used instead of quadratic residuosity. Also, if the prover is allowed to have exponential computing power, then one-way permutations are sufficient for bounded noninteractive zero-knowledge proofs.

A PTM computes a partial function that assigns to each input the output which occurs with a probability greater than half. It is shown that an NDTM can be simulated by a PTM in the same space but with a small error probability. Gill also considers the complexity classes RP, PP, and BPP for polynomial-time probabilistic Turing Machines (see Section 4.1). He shows that P c RP c BPP C PP C PSPACE and that RP c NP c PP.

IEEE, New York, 474-479. The various resources such as number of envelopes, number of oblivious transfers, and total amount of communication required by zero-knowledge !oro~ocols are considered. The paper presents a technique of executing k rounds of a protocol, which guarantees that any polynomial number of NP-theorems can be proved noninteractively in zero knowledge, with the probability of accepting a false theorem below 1/2k. The main result in this paper assumes the existence of trap-door permutations in order to implement the oblivious-transfer protocol.

Re~schuk showed that the former can be done in constant time with probability 1 - 2 cnll~81 and the latter in O(log n) time. Both algorithms meet the corresponding information-theoretic lower bounds in terms of processor time product as well as the optimal speedup attainable using n processors. An earlier version appeared as Reischuk { 1981}.
REISCHUK, R. 1981. A fast probabilistic parallel sorting algorithm. In Proceedings of the 22nd Annual IEEE Symposzum on the Foundations of Computer Science. IEEE, New York, 212 219. Reischuk considers the problems of selecting k smallest elements out of a set of n keys and sorting the n elements using n processors in parallel. He shows that the former can be done m constant time with probability i- 2 ~n~Js~ and the latter in O(log n) time. This achieves the information-theoretic lower bound in terms of processor time product as well as the optimal speedup attainable using n processors.

Another test for primality based on the abundance of witnesses to compositeness of n is presented. The test entails picking a random number a (1 _< a < n) and computing ~ = a(n-~)/2(mod n), where -1< ~<n-2. If the Jacobi symbol 8 = (a/n) equals e then n is prime; else, if either gcd(a, n) > i or S ~= ~, decide n to be composite. The second decision has less than 1/2 probability of being wrong.

Associate a variable x,j with each edge e~j c E and define the n x n matrix B = b,j as follows. If there is no edge between vertex i and vertex j them b~j = 0. Otherwise,b~j = x,j if i >j and b~j = -x~j if i <j. This paper proves that G has a perfect matching if and only if det(B) ~ 0.

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. 1983. Reference Manual for the Ada Programming Language. MIL-STD 1815A, U.S. Dept. of Defense, Washington, D.C. Section 3.2 of our survey discusses a randomized distributed algorithm for the scheduling of input and output guards. The designers of Ada chose only to allow nondeterministic choice among the accept alternatives of a select statement. This design decision makes the guard-scheduling problem in Ada much easier and, in particular, obliviates the need for randomization.
VALIANT, L.G. 1984a. Short monotone formulae for the majority function. J. Alg. 5, 3, 363 366. A probabilistic approximation of a deterministic boolean function can yield simple circuits having a small proportion of inputs that cause wrong outputs. Independent probabilistic approximations of the same function can be combined to reduce the probability of error. In this paper Valiant uses such a technique to obtain O(n53)-size monotone formulas that compute the majority function of n boolean variables.

IEEE, New York, 417 428. This paper analyzes the behavior of randomized algorithms where perfectly random sources are substituted with sources which have small bias and dependence. It shows that if a problem can be solved by a polynomial-time Monte Carlo algorithm which has access to a true source of randomness, then the same problem can be solved using an arbitrarily weak semirandom source.

YAO, A. C. 1979 The complexity of pattern matching for a random string. SIAM J. Cornput. 8, 3 (Aug.), 368-387. Yao proves that the minimum average number of characters which need be examined in a random string of length n for locating patterns of length m, in an alphabet with q symbols, is O({logq((nm/ln m)+ 2)1) if m _< n _< 2m and 0(({logq m}/m)n) if n > 2m. This confirms Knuth et al.'s {1977} conjecture.

ZUCKERMAN, D 1990. General weak random sources. In Proceedings of the 31st Annual IEEE Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science. IEEE, New York, 534-543. A pseudorandom generator that depends only on a weak random source is exhibited. By a weak random source it is meant that (1) the source is asked only once for R random bits and (2) the source outputs an R-bit string such that no string has a probability more than 2 sR of being output, for some fixed S > 0. This paper shows how to simulate RP using a string from a &source in time n~(l~g~), or in polynomial time under the Generalized Paley Graph Conjecture. See Zuckerman {1991} for a correction to a result in this paper.
