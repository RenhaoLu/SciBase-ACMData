As data-intensive, network-based applications proliferate, the power consumed by the data-center storage subsystem surges. This survey summarizes, organizes, and integrates a decade of research on power-aware enterprise storage systems. All of the existing power-reduction techniques are classified according to the disk-power factor and storage-stack layer addressed. A majority of power-reduction techniques is based on dynamic power management. We also consider alternative methods that reduce disk access time, conserve space, or exploit energy-efficient storage hardware. For every energy-conservation technique, the fundamental trade-offs between power, capacity, performance, and dependability are uncovered. With this survey, we intend to stimulate integration of different power-reduction techniques in new energy-efficient file and storage systems.
