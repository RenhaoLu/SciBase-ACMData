The capabilities of current fault-handling techniques for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) develop a descriptive classification ranging from simple passive techniques to robust dynamic methods. Fault-handling methods not requiring modification of the FPGA device architecture or user intervention to recover from faults are examined and evaluated against overhead-based and sustainability-based performance metrics such as additional resource requirements, throughput reduction, fault capacity, and fault coverage. This classification alongside these performance metrics forms a standard for confident comparisons.
