In this article we survey ambient intelligence (AmI), including its applications, some of the technologies it uses, and its social and ethical implications. The applications include AmI at home, care of the elderly, healthcare, commerce, and business, recommender systems, museums and tourist scenarios, and group decision making. Among technologies, we focus on ambient data management and artificial intelligence; for example planning, learning, event-condition-action rules, temporal reasoning, and agent-oriented technologies. The survey is not intended to be exhaustive, but to convey a broad range of applications, technologies, and technical, social, and ethical challenges.
